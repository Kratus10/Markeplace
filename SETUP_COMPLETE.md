## Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM. The updated schema includes:

- Subscription model for premium access
- Message model for private messaging
- Topic and Comment models for the forum
- Category model for forum organization

## Development Notes

- All database models are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Authentication is handled by NextAuth.js with credentials and Google providers
- Premium features are gated by active subscription status
- Messages can only be sent between premium users
- Forum topics and comments are moderated through status fields

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure your database is running and accessible
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set in `.env`
3. Run `npx prisma generate` if you make schema changes
4. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply pending migrations
