## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
Both profile API routes now include rate limiting to prevent abuse:
- Maximum 10 requests per minute per user
- Proper HTTP headers for rate limit information
- Clear error messages when rate limit is exceeded

### 2. Improved UI/UX
- Gradient backgrounds for card headers
- Better spacing and visual hierarchy
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Loading states with spinner animations
- Premium badges for premium users
- Enhanced form elements with better validation

### 3. Enhanced Privacy Controls
- Toggle switches for each profile field visibility
- Real-time preview of privacy settings
- Better organization of privacy controls

### 4. Better Error Handling
- More descriptive error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Graceful degradation when errors occur

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Implementation
We implemented a simple in-memory rate limiter for development purposes. In production, this should be replaced with a Redis-based solution for distributed rate limiting.

### Component Structure
The profile page is organized into:
1. User information card (left sidebar)
2. Main content area with:
   - Edit profile form
   - Privacy settings form
   - Navigation cards to other sections

### API Routes
Both API routes follow the same pattern:
1. Authentication check
2. Rate limiting
3. Business logic
4. Proper response with rate limit headers

## Testing
Created comprehensive unit tests for:
- Profile schema validation
- API route authentication
- API route functionality
- Rate limiting behavior

## Next Steps
1. Run `npm run dev` to test the implementation
2. Navigate to `/profile` to view the enhanced profile page
3. Test editing profile information and privacy settings
4. Verify rate limiting works by making multiple rapid requests
