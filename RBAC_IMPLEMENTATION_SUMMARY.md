# RBAC Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in the Next.js Marketplace application.

## Role Hierarchy

The application implements the following role hierarchy:

1. **OWNER** - Highest level of access, can perform all administrative functions
2. **ADMIN_L2** - Senior administrator with broad administrative capabilities
3. **ADMIN_L1** - Junior administrator with limited administrative capabilities
4. **MODERATOR** - Can moderate content but cannot manage users or roles
5. **USER** - Regular user with no administrative privileges

## Implemented Features

### 1. Middleware Protection

- Added role-based middleware to protect admin routes
- `/admin` routes are restricted to OWNER role only
- `/admin/l1` routes are accessible to OWNER, ADMIN_L1, and ADMIN_L2 roles

### 2. Admin L1 Dashboard

- Created a dedicated dashboard for ADMIN_L1 users at `/admin/l1`
- Includes tabs for moderation queue, subcategory management, and topic moving
- Server-side role validation to prevent unauthorized access

### 3. API Endpoints

Created new API endpoints for ADMIN_L1 functionality:

- `/api/admin/l1/assign-moderator` - Assign MODERATOR role to users
- `/api/admin/l1/create-subcategory` - Create forum subcategories
- `/api/admin/l1/move-topic` - Move topics between categories

### 4. Audit Logging

Implemented comprehensive audit logging for:

- User role changes
- Topic moves
- Content moderation actions
- Failed access attempts

### 5. Playwright Tests

Created test suites to verify RBAC functionality:

- `owner-access.spec.ts` - Tests for OWNER role access
- `adminl1-access.spec.ts` - Tests for ADMIN_L1 role access
- `move-topic.spec.ts` - Tests for topic moving functionality

## Key Implementation Details

### Role Validation

Role validation is implemented using a hierarchy approach where higher-level roles automatically inherit permissions from lower-level roles.

### Security Considerations

- All admin API endpoints include server-side role validation
- Sensitive operations (like role changes) require appropriate authorization levels
- Audit logs capture all administrative actions for security review

### Future Enhancements

- Add "safety throttles" for bulk moderation operations
- Implement two-step approval for exporting unredacted data
- Add `canViewPII` flag for more granular privacy controls
- Add audit "reason required" UI for role changes
