# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Registration API Response Format**
   - **Problem**: The registration API was returning plain text errors, but the frontend was trying to parse them as JSON, causing "JSON syntax" errors.
   - **Fix**: Updated the registration API to return all responses in JSON format with consistent error structure.

2. **Profile API Response Format**
   - **Problem**: Similar to registration, the profile API was returning plain text errors.
   - **Fix**: Updated the profile API to return all responses in JSON format.

3. **Authentication Error Handling**
   - **Problem**: Generic "Configuration" errors were shown to users instead of meaningful messages.
   - **Fix**: Created a dedicated error page with user-friendly error messages and added proper error mapping.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- Updated `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to return JSON responses
- Updated `/app/api/user/profile/route.ts` to return JSON responses
- Added validation for password length in registration

### Frontend Changes
- No changes needed to frontend as it was already correctly handling JSON responses
- Added error page at `/app/auth/error/page.tsx` for better error display

### Error Handling Improvements
- Created user-friendly error messages for common authentication errors
- Added detailed error information in development mode
- Maintained security by not exposing sensitive information

## Testing Results
- Registration now works correctly with proper JSON responses
- Duplicate registration is properly rejected with clear error messages
- Error handling is improved with user-friendly messages
- Login should now work correctly without "Configuration" errors

## Next Steps
1. Test login functionality with the registered user
2. Verify profile page loads correctly after login
3. Test error scenarios to ensure proper messages are displayed
