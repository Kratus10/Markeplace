# Login and Profile Page Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Registration API Response Format**
   - Fixed the registration API to return consistent JSON responses instead of plain text
   - This was causing the "JSON syntax" errors during registration

2. **Profile API Response Format**
   - Updated the profile API to return JSON responses for consistency

3. **Authentication Error Handling**
   - Created a dedicated error page with user-friendly error messages
   - Replaced generic "Configuration" errors with meaningful messages

4. **Login Redirect Issue**
   - Added debugging to the login page to track the authentication flow
   - Improved session handling in the profile page

5. **Profile Page Session Handling**
   - Enhanced the profile page to properly wait for session establishment
   - Added better error logging and debugging information

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes
- Updated `/app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to return JSON responses
